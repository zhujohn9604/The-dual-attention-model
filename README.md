# The dual-attention model

The repository implements GCN-based GAE for monitoring technology convergence. The **example.py** demonstrates how to use GCN to generate patent and technological keywords vectors and technology intensity coordinates.


### With pip

This repository is built on the Package dgl version 0.4.3 and Pytorch with a GTX 1080 Ti graphics card.

DGL with cuda (e.g., cuda version 10.1) can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install dgl-cu101==0.4.3
```

DGL (CPU only) can be installed using pip as follows:

```bash
pip install dgl==0.4.3
```

### Usage
If you want to customize the model to your own datasets, please go first to check the **Sample** folder for data formats.
